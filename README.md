Air pollution poses a serious threat to public health, environmental quality, and sustainable growth. As cities expand, pollution levels often increase due to vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and other anthropogenic sources, leading to higher Air Quality Index (AQI) readings and adverse health effects. Traditional air quality monitoring systems provide data but often lack interactive elements that engage the public in active pollution reduction.

This project addresses the need for both accurate AQI data and community-driven pollution management. Our platform not only monitors and calculates real-time AQI data but also encourages users to take eco-friendly actions that reduce their pollution footprint. By integrating a rewards system, users are incentivized to participate in sustainable activities, such as using public transportation, planting trees, and conserving energy, creating a community-centered approach to pollutionÂ management.
